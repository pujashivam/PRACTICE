	   <h2 id="Dhanbad"><u>Dhanbad</u></h2>
			<p>The city of Dhanbad used to be a part of the Manbhum region, which fell under the Bihar region and was under the control of the Mundari tribes. Even a lot of powerful kingdoms, such as Sasankas, ruled the ancient city of Dhanbad. During British rule, the city was one of the districts of East India, which was surrounded by dense forests and was known for the rich mineral resources present in the city. A lot of people from different religious and social groups used to live in the city.

After India got its independence, the city of Dhanbad became a part of Bihar. In 1950, when the re-organization of states took place, the city became a part of West Bengal. During the same year, the present-day Purulia district moved out of the Manbhum district. When the settlement report of Manbhum was made in the year 1928, it was mentioned that no rock inscriptions, old coins, or old copper plates were found during the survey and settlement operations of the land. The documents found during the oldest times were inscribed in paper and were done about 100 years before.

The city of Dhanbad stayed in the Manbhum district from the year 1928 to 1956. Dhanbad was specially declared as a separate district in the year 1956 on October 24. The “States Reorganization Commission gave the following recommendation.” The following decision was taken in the leadership of Satish Chandra, who was a renowned journalist at that time.


In the year 2006, the city of Dhanbad celebrated the golden jubilee of being an independent district. The city remained under Bihar from November 14, 2000. Dhanbad’s city became a part of Jharkhand after the state was created on November 15, 2000.

Jharkhand’s government could have been richer because of the huge number of coal mines present in Dhanbad. Jharkhand’s government couldn’t enjoy this opportunity because of the nuisance made by the coal mafias and the gang wars that took place in the state. Dhanbad and Wasseypur faced a lot of conflicts and were adversely affected by the gang wars.
